      I have a very deep interest in video games, music, and animation that
      inspires me to create and develop my own personal media. Although my main
      passion is through my work as an artist, I am also interested in learning
      computer science concepts to further widen my horizons. This website will
      hopefully show you my works and achievements that I have done throughout
      my time as a student.
